Carlton Homes

Carlton Homes is a (fake) site for a custom home building company.

Made from scratch (including slogans, etc.; no bootstrap, etc.).

Note:  This site is front end only and is not functional.
Note:  Only tested on Chrome browser.
Note:  Not properly responsive; only works when browser is full size but not full screen.  (If things aren't properly lined up, resize the browser until things are properly lined up after the animation ends (i.e., grass is just under the floor of the house) and then refresh page to view animation properly.)
